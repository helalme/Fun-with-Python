## Saving some of interesting code snippet for learning purpose, part of assignments of a coursework
 

#### findMaxMinFromArbitraryInput.py: 
Example of a clever coding. These few lines will find maximum and minimum numbers from the user input. 
User can enter anything, anytimes arbitrarily. Just enter "done" at the end. The condition is no complex data structure (e.g. list, tuple), no other package or library, no library function (e.g. isnumeric() or isdigit()) can be used. Only int() and input() functions can be used.

#### findEmailAddressFromTxtAndPrintMaxOccurence.py: 
Read the file mbox-short.txt, find sender email address that occurs maximum. Print that address and occurance

#### findIncomingTimeOfEmailsAndMakeFrequency.py: 
Read the file mbox-short.txt, read incoming time of each email, count the frequency for each hour and print

### readExtractSumPrint.py: 
Read a text file from URL, extract integer numbers from that, make a sum and print, all in one line of Python code. By doing like this, the code clarity, readability and maintainability etc. are lost.
